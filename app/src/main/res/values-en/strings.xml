    <string name="gosling">  James Arthur Gosling, OC (born May 19, 1955) is a Canadian computer
        scientist,best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java programming language.\n
    Gosling initially became known as the author of Gosling Emacs, and also invented the windowing
        system NeWS, which lost out to X Window because Sun did not give it an open source license.
        He is generally credited with having invented the Java programming language in 1994.
        He created the original design of Java and implemented the language\'s original compiler and
        virtual machine. Gosling traces the origins of the approach to his early graduate-student
        days, when he created a p-code virtual machine for the lab\'s DEC VAX computer, so that his
        professor could run programs written in UCSD Pascal. In the work leading to Java at Sun,
        he saw that architecture-neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be achieved
        by implementing a similar philosophy: always program for the same virtual machine.

    <string name="ada">  Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27
        November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles
        Babbage\'s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the
        first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published
        the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is
        sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine"
        and one of the first computer programmers.</string>
